An MVP design should atleast be based on solving one of the 3 problems or a combination of them

1. Are you trying to reduce the cycle time of operation or business solution delivery?
2. Are you trying to reduce the cost of developing/maintaining the application?
3. Are you solving an application engineering problem like redesigning the application flow, removing redundant business process, other engg. issues?

Once you have an idea of the problem to solve, you should identify how much work would overhauling the processes and practices around the applicatiin solution delivery task take.

Once all of this is understood, you can create your MVP design flow and get a guesstimate cost of your MVP( I would still prefer a driver driven scientific cost estimation though!)

This process works universally and leads to less pre-implementation exploration lead times.
