Every line of our code follows standards, and high-quality code ensures scalability, so you are no longer limited through the technology.

## Leadership through software development

We have the same mission in mind – to help you achieve your goals.
Planning, development, and communication customized for your business.


### Fit the Best Solutions
Technology suited to your current and future needs.


### Engineer Your Success
Rapdily development and short cycles with timely communication.


### Launch & Grow
Full support and maintenance.


## MVP

An MVP design should atleast be based on solving one of the 3 problems or a combination of them

1. Are you trying to reduce the cycle time of operation or business solution delivery?
2. Are you trying to reduce the cost of developing/maintaining the application?
3. Are you solving an application engineering problem like redesigning the application flow, removing redundant business process, other engg. issues?

Once you have an idea of the problem to solve, you should identify how much work would overhauling the processes and practices around the applicatiin solution delivery task take.

Once all of this is understood, you can create your MVP design flow and get a guesstimate cost of your MVP( I would still prefer a driver driven scientific cost estimation though!)

This process works universally and leads to less pre-implementation exploration lead times.

# Our offer

    Get the right product,
    created at the right time,
    and at the right price

To start the project in the right way, the most important part is collecting all the requirements to transform them into an initial estimation of the marketplace platform. To achieve that in the best possible way, we have a special service – Vision-To-Plan Workshops.

Every project is different, so we approach each workshop differently. Perhaps you already have one of the marketplace platforms (CS-Cart, WordPress website with WordPress plugin, or any other), we may help you with analyzing the source code, show online demo or you want to show us one of the online stores you like.

As a result of the workshop, you will get a complete architecture of your Multi-Vendor Marketplace (including marketplace software). So, the first two (and the most important) steps from the graphic are covered by the workshop. The rest of the processes is the implementation of the established requirements.

    You may save up to €10 in needless development costs on every €1 spent on planning during workshops. One-time payment = Long-term investment.





## Vision-To-Plan
The way we turn your goals into a ready-to-execute plan
The best way to get to know each other is real-time meeting. On our part, you can expect the following people during eCommerce workshops:

+ Project Manager – The person who will take care of your project success. Translates business requirements into specified functionalities.
+ Senior Developer(s) – One or two senior developers, depending on the complexity of the project. He will be responsible for building your project architecture and selecting appropriate technologies. You can be sure that he will do his best to translate your vision into an actual project.
+ Designer (optional)


### 1 Meeting, Workshop, 30 Minutes
To achieve great things, you need a plan. 
We will prepare a workshop schedule for you based on your business goals, requirements, and expectations regarding technology.
Although each workshop is a different adventure and need, we have created business workshop processes that allow us to gather information well.

+ A well-prepared development plan will allow you to avoid unplanned costs. The more precisely the better for your e-business!
+ Workshops are needed so that we can get to know each other’s expectations. Both you and we can determine whether we will decide to cooperate or not.

### The first step to understand your goals

Let yourself achieve success with the right product, created at the right time, and at the right price. 
To understand better your vision, we provide the eCommerce workshops service.
During the workshops, you will tell us about all your needs and expectations to let us better understand your goals.

Take a look at the following sentences related to your project:

    You don’t know how much it can cost
    You want to make sure that your vision is appropriate
    You want to know if you have chosen suitable technologies
    You want to choose the best technologies
    You need an MVP but don’t know where to start
    You need an accurate estimate of the project implementation
    You want to have a solid architecture

If the statements above are close to you, Vision-To-Plan eCommerce Workshop is the best choice for you.

### Technologies
Selection of the best technologies
There are dozen of different technologies, so choosing the best one may seem like rocket science. 
We will propose you a perfectly tailored solution that lets you achieve your business goals.

### Time Estimation

Adequate time of realization your project
If someone tells you that they can do your project in a week, don't believe them. 
Don't compromise on quality to get something quickly. We will estimate the optimal (and real!) delivery time for you.

### Cost Estimation

Precisely defined cost
After we will know the time of realization, we can provide you with the right estimation. You will receive a document with the detailed specification, hourly breakdown, and cost of each part of the project.

### Energy Estimation

to find the best way for your business model
looking for a shortcuts
The best way to achieve the first two steps is to take part in the eCommerce workshop. You can be sure we consider each case individually, and the results will be unique.
By participating in the workshop, you will get to know that for every €1 spent on planning, you can save up to €10 in additional development costs.
After getting to know each other’s expectations, we may decide if we are a good fit for each other. If so, our cooperation will start!

### Pricing model

Depending on the type of project, both options may be beneficial. It is important to choose the right model for the nature of the project.
We can implement the project in the form of Fixed Price or Time and Material. We talk about how we implement the project from the very beginning of the talks. However, it should be remembered that the eCommerce website is a product that is constantly evolving and it is never a closed product. It is not a thing that will be created once and will always be the same. Requirements can be changed, updated, or expanded at any time.



### Project team structure

Our pillar of success is the team, engaged and ready to create a project:

+ Project Manager – “The Connector” between business and technology – he makes sure that everything is done correctly and keeps track of the time
+ Developers – “The Creator” – he turns visions into products
+ Quality Assurance – “The Bug Detective” – he verifies the system
+ (Optional) Designer – “The Artist” – thanks to him your eCommerce will have a beautiful UI and good UX
    
    
### Communication

We prefer to communicate via Slack/discord
We will create a special channel so that we can communicate and exchange information as quickly as possible. 
Sometimes it happens that we communicate with the client via other channels, such as e-mail or Google Hangouts.

+ Daily calls – during this internal meeting, we plan our work every day. We look for solutions and discuss – all in order to deliver a solution as soon as possible

+ Weekly calls – a meeting in which the client is participating.  This is the time to discuss current progress, establish priorities, and plan further development in the near future.

### Monitoring

+ Information about company resource planning – control and management of the most important electronic data and internal processes in almost every business area of the company: sales channels, marketing, finance, accounting, warehouse and other businesses’ parts.

+ Information about product –  thanks to the B2B eCommerce PIM solution, you will have the exact product content in one catalog (size, color, weight, material, product description, photos, etc.). Cover all marketing efforts from one PIM system, improve quality information and search in the catalog on the website and sell more to your customers/consumers

+ Information about suppliers –  Get a complete view of the supply chain, receive numerous goods from suppliers, handle multiple partners (and businesses), take care of your customers/consumers
+ Information about media files – B2B eCommerce PIM systems’ main benefits are: large product catalog (with catalog management, master catalog), rich product information and also support in sales

If you are an online retailer who wants to sell directly to your target audience and new customers on different channels and digital touchpoints, and at the same time have lots of product data, Product Information Management (PIM) is a good choice for you. 
Increase your businesses sales right now with PIM!

### Multiple channels
Multi-channeling like eCommerce, mobile applications, social networks, marketplaces could be challenging for eCommerce platforms. PIM solutions will help you and allow you to manage them from one source of truth. Influence the engagement of customers and increase sales with PIM.

### Data classification
Create specific products experience and associate them together with product information management (PIM). Analyze your products easily and propose cross-selling or up-selling to increase customer interactions (and, of course, sales). With product catalog management it's easier than ever.

### Localization of content
Linguistic localization is the process of adapting the translation of a text to the needs of a given country or region. Thanks to this, you will be able to adapt a given product to the local market's needs and improve your (brand) position in the target market.

### Managing information
Manage information on all sales channels, in one location with a single source of data (instead of many other systems). Export product data from print catalogs to electronic product data. Product information management processes with master catalog management, print catalog management increase the importance of product experience.
